# dotfiles

Making bashing and vimming a whole lot easier

## Getting started

Run the makelinks script to create links in your home directory to the corresponding files in the repository. Any existing dot files will be saved into a separate folder in case you need to refer back to or restore them.

```
./makelinks.sh
```

Be sure to restart your terminal (or re-run bash) to allow bash to pick up the changes.
